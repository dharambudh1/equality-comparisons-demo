# Equality Comparisons Demo

## Description:

It is a sample code for equality comparison in the Dart. It means comparing two object's properties (all properties) of the same class. 

In the Dart, there are two well-known techniques to compare it.
1. With overriding double equals operator and hash code
2. With the use of equatable

Note: you can't compare two objects with the double equals operator (without overriding the double equals operator). If you do, it'll surely fail.
